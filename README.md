# LearnMining
This project is for educational purposes exploring different cryptography algorithms used by cryptocurrencies 
such as bitcoin to mine new blocks.  
Additional effort has gone into implementing hash algorithms from scratch and attempt at optimizing the algorithm 
and the c# code as much as possible.  
The code contains lots of comments explaining almost everything.  
For now only bitcoin mining (double SHA256) is implemented but new algorithms will be added in the future.
